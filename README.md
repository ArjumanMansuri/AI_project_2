List of all submitted files:
1. spam_detector.py :
This file contains all the functions related to build a probabilistic model from the training set for SPAM detector (which will create model.txt file) plus all the functions related to test the model on given test dataset. This file will create a single file called result.txt with classification results wether it's SPAM or HAM. 

2. model.txt :
The resulting model from spam_detector.py will be saved in this files as per given format in project description.

3. result.txt :
For each test file, the classification result will be saved in this file.

Note: Please go through the submitted report for detail analysis of classifier.

To run the code:
Paste both train and test dataset folders where the spam_detector.py is located. 
1. With command line,
with terminal, go to the folder where the spam_detector.py is located and run below command:

python spam_detector.py

This will generate both model.txt and result.txt.

2. with pycharm IDE
Open the files in IDE. Paste train and test dataset folder with the file. Run the spam_detector.py. It'll generate model.txt and result.txt.
