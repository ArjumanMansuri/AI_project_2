List of all submitted files:
1. spam_ham_detector_dictionary.py :
This file contains all the functions related to build a probabilistic model from the training set for SPAM detector.

2. evaluating_model.py :
This file contains all the functions related to test the model on given test dataset. This file will create a single file called result.txt with classification results wether it's SPAM or HAM. 

3. model.txt :
The resulting model from spam_ham_detector_dictionary will be saved in this files as per given format in project description.

4. result.txt :
For each test file, the classification result will be saved in this file.

To run the code:
In Pycharm IDE, Paste both train and test dataset folders.
1. Open the files, 1st run the spam_ham_detector_dictionary.py. It'll generate model.txt.
2. Run evaluating_model.py. This file will generate result.txt.
